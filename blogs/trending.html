       <h3> TRENDING BLOGS INFORMATION</h3>

        <h3>01. Food blogs</h3>

<h6>Food blogs come in several flavors. On the one hand, there are the food critics, who go from one restaurant table to the next, tasting different dishes and narrating their experiences. On the other hand, there’s the cooking and baking enthusiasts. They document their recipes—from the ingredients they use to the steps they follow—and share them with their communities through articles, photos and videos.
 					<br>Know that the work also comes with great perks. Critics often get to dine for free at restaurants. If you’re more on the cooking side, you may meet opportunities to publish cookbooks and collaborate with food networks. Despite the competition food blogging is a great way to build a food loving online community of like minded people. </br></h6>

<h3>02. Health and fitness blogs</h3>
<h6>Start by making a list of your own routines and habits, and turn them into guides filled with exact steps. For obvious reasons, people expect to find videos on these types of blogs, so buying a decent camera and using Wix Video is sometbhing to consider when you begin.
<br>
Writing a wellness and sports blog can be the beginning of a very fruitful journey. You can follow the steps of certified personal trainers and dietitians such as Nora Minno and use a scheduling software to increase clientele. Other bloggers also sell workout guides, diet recipe ebooks, supplements and workout apparel.
</h6>
<h3> 03. Lifestyle blogs</h3>
<h6>Lifestyle blogs are the new magazines. As we once flipped through pages, nowadays, we scroll for inspiration. Lifestyle bloggers create multimedia centered content around their daily lives. Therefore, these types of blogs often integrate vlogs (video blogs) to engage their audience and to show their expertise. These bloggers later tend to partner with brands as micro-influencers.<br>


For example, Laura Baross focuses on sustainable living and design. Her interests and opinions vary from topics such as second-hand fashion to compostable toothbrushes. Maybe you don’t identify as an environmentalist, but you surely have something that makes your own lifestyle inspiring.</h6>
<h3>04. Fashion and beauty blogs</h3>
<h6>
 Like words, fashion is a way we express ourselves. No surprise, there are almost as many fashion blogs as there are fashionistas in this world. Some are about luxury, others about streetwear, and some others even specialize in recycled textiles. They all offer outfit inspiration, trend updates and insider reviews. For example, Olivia + Laura offer straightforward advice for keeping up with trends.<br>


Fashion blogs represent a lot of work, but they can pay off with invites to exclusive events and fashion shows. The perks don’t end there. Free clothing and beauty products are often gifted in exchange for promotion. If these benefits sparked your interests, you could start by putting together an eye-catching outfit, photographing it, and writing how you’ve decided to pair those items and colors together. Consider adding a link to the worn items. Readers might want to replicate and shop your look.</h6>
<h3>5. Business blogs</h3>
<h6>Some of the most successful entrepreneurs and CEOs of the world attribute their success to continually reading. Where do they stay updated? Many professionals turn to business blogs to sharpen their industry knowledge, uncover the latest news, and learn of the challenges happening in a selected field. For example, Leading Conflict addresses how to deal with conflict in the workplace.<br>


Other business bloggers focus more specifically on one function, such as B2B marketing blogs. Positioning themselves as experts in the field, they can sell gated e-books to people wanting more detailed guidance.</h6>
