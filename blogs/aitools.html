<h1>CHAT GPT</h1>
           <br><h1>What is ChatGPT?</h1></br>
<b>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts, essays, code and emails.<br>ChatGPT is a form of generative AI -- a tool that lets users enter prompts to receive humanlike images, text or videos that are created by AI.

ChatGPT is similar to the automated chat services found on customer service websites, as people can ask it questions or request clarification to ChatGPT's replies. The GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer," which refers to how ChatGPT processes requests and formulates responses. ChatGPT is trained with reinforcement learning through human feedback and reward models that rank the best responses. This feedback helps augment ChatGPT with machine learning to improve future responses.</b>
<br><h1>Who created ChatGPT?</h1></br>
<b>OpenAI -- an artificial intelligence research company -- created ChatGPT and launched the tool in November 2022. It was founded by a group of entrepreneurs and researchers including Elon Musk and Sam Altman in 2015. OpenAI is backed by several investors, with Microsoft being the most notable. OpenAI also created Dall-E, an AI text-to-art generator.</b>
<br><h1>How does ChatGPT work?</h1></br>
<b>ChatGPT works through its Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which uses specialized algorithms to find patterns within data sequences. ChatGPT originally used the GPT-3 large language model, a neural network machine learning model and the third generation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The transformer pulls from a significant amount of data to formulate a response</b>

        <h1>CHARACTER AI</h1>
        <br><h1>what is character AI?</h1></br>
 <b>Character AI is an artificial intelligence chatbot web application that uses neutral language models to generate text responses, allows for user-developed characters, and allows you to chat with fictional, historical, and celebrity figures in a dialogue. Unlike other AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Character AI’s output is more human-like and allows you to chat with more than one bot at a time, offering different perspectives. Developed by former Google AI developers Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, Character AI was released in beta form in September 2022. Since its launch, it has become one of the most popular AI chatbots behind ChatGPT.<b>
<br><h1>How Does Character AI Work?</h1></br>
<b>Built on large language models (LLM), Character AI is powered by deep machine learning, focusing primarily on conversations. During the training process, Character AI’s supercomputer continuously read large amounts of text, then learned to determine which words might come next in a sentence. The result is a highly entertaining, human-like AI that makes you feel like you’re talking to a real person. In this way, Character AI is more advanced than other AI chatbots because it allows users to immerse themselves in conversation with all types of personalities, including historical figures, celebrities, and other characters created by the community.<br>As previously mentioned, these characters are more lifelike than other chatbots, so you feel like you are talking to an actual human being. Another benefit of this incredible AI is that you can create your own characters to interact with. It’s as easy as assigning a few parameters to give your character a personality, adding an avatar (which you can generate with the software itself), and you’re off to the races. Plus, you can take Character AI wherever you go, thanks to the new Android and iOS apps.<br>Another thing that sets Character AI apart is themes. Nearly twenty are available, including helpers, games, image generating bosts, movie and tv actors, and language learning.</b>
<br><h1>Benefits of Using Character AI</h1></br>
<b>There are a lot of unique benefits of using Character AI. First and foremost, it’s a great way to dialogue with different characters, giving you different perspectives. You can chat with Elon Musk, Edward Cullen from the popular Twilight books, or even Taylor Swift.</b>
<br><h1>What are the Limitations of Character AI?</h1></br>
<b>Character AI is an impressive example of artificial intelligence, but it has limitations. Since the community creates these characters, false results, called hallucinations, are frequently generated. When you begin chatting with the various characters, it’s important to consider where they originate from and expect that most, if not all, of what they say is made up. Another limitation is image generation. While you can enable your characters to generate images, they do not belong to the same class as other AI art generators, primarily because it was created mainly as a text generator. Additionally, it implements strict filtering, blocking any content considered unsafe for work (NSFW). This is a good thing depending on what you want to use it for. Finally, it doesn’t offer an API, so even though it’s open source, you can’t download it and create your own iteration on a local machine.</b>

        <br><h1>What is Synthesia?</h1></br>
<b>Synthesia is an AI-driven video creation tool that empowers you to produce high-quality, engaging videos without expensive equipment or specialized skills. It takes a unique approach to create videos by way of generating AI avatars (synthetic people that are human-like) that appear to be speaking words that you give it from a video script.</b><br>
<br><a>Synthesia Features</a><br>
<b>Synthesia might just be one of your new favorite AI tools if you want to supplement your video creation workflow. Its ability as a multimodel generative AI system means that Synthesia performs very well at a host of tasks. Some of its features include:
<br>1.Dozens of AI Avatars
<br>2.Templates and Custom Backgrounds
<br>3.AI Translation
<br>4.Media Library and Collaboration <br>
<br><a>How to Create a Video in Synthesia</a><br><br>
<b>Getting started with a new video is easy. You can select your starting point after clicking the “New Video” button near the top right. You can start from a blank canvas, with AI, importing a PowerPoint, or from a template. Starting from a template is likely the fastest way to create a video and is a good place for new users to start.</b>
