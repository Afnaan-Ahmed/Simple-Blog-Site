          <b>
          Talking about the design of the new Punch.ev, the design is very much the same as the ICE punch except for the front end. The front end is completely re-designed and is heavily inspired by the newly launched Nexon.ev. At the front, it gets a blanked-out grille with a flap for the charging port in the middle.</b>
          <br><a>Front end design info:</a></br>
          <b>
          It gets an LED light strip that runs across the bonnet and below it gets a split headlamp setup with LED lighting. Below it gets air intakes on both ends and a scuff plate. Overall from the front the Punch.ev looks like a mini Nexon.ev.</b>
          <br><a>Side profile:</a><br>
          <b>
          At the side, there’s no change made to the car, it gets the same the high beltline and pillar-mounted rear door handle are all carried over. But here it gets.EV badging on front doors and it also gets differently designed 16-inch alloy wheels wrapped up in 190/60 section EV-specific Apollo tyres.<br></b>

        <br><z>MAHINDRA THAR</z></br>
        <b>The Mahindra Thar has evolved from a simple, old off-roader to a versatile and modern SUV that can take you anywhere in comfort. Available with multiple drivetrain options and many variants, the Thar offers loads of road presence and strong performance both on and off the road. However, its two-door configuration puts a small dent on the practicality front.</b>
        <br><a>Mahindra Thar Price</a></br>
        <b>Mahindra Thar price for the base model starts at Rs. 11.25 Lakh and the top model price goes upto Rs. 17.20 Lakh (Avg. ex-showroom). </b>
        <br><a>Thar Convenience & Technology:</a></br>
        <b>The Thar stands out wherever it goes. It has plenty of road presence, looks fit for its purpose, and with so much potential for both visual and performance modes, makes for a great blank canvas for the adventurous kind. 
        The petrol-powered Thar is surprisingly quick. The 2.0-litre, 150bhp and 320Nm-producing, mStallion engine is coupled with an automatic six-speed torque convertor gearbox and offers thrilling performance. 
        Naturally, the Thar is incredibly capable when you take it off the road. It has huge, knobbly tyres, a fairly modern 4x4 system with low range, and impressive ground clearance and approach angle.  </b>
        <br><a>Thar Safety:</a></br>
        <b>In terms of safety features, the Thar comes with driver and front passenger airbags, ESP, seatbelt warning, anchor points for child seats, over-speed warning, and central locking. 
        The Mahindra Thar comes with a four-star rating for both adult and child occupants in Global NCAPs crash tests. </b>
